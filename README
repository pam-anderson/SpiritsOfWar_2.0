            DFS around each opponent to depth of threshhold, add 1 to each tile found in the DFS. 
            DFS from current character to depth of the movement in last level of search, choose 
            lowest value tile (if applicable, else go to lower level)
            
        - keep distance values, choose path w/lowest distance.
